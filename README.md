These wireless transmitters and receivers easily fit into a breadboard and work well with microcontrollers to create
a very simple wireless data link. The original legacy VirtualWire library that is used in this GitHub repo can be found [here](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire/). However, we recommend using the latest [RadioHead library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/), which supports more architectures.
